PyMC3 User Guide
================

_This is meant to be a learning exercise for myself, not an exhaustive showcase of features of [PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3)._ 

While my naming is obviously inspired by the fantastic [Stan User Guide](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_25/stan-users-guide/index.html), my goal for this repo is only to be a sort of reference manual for techniques and models which I commonly use. This is why I will be comparing models aginst scikit-learn (where applicable) since that's the tool I am most familiar with right now. 

Considering the very specific goals of this repo I will not be following the [Bayesian Workflow](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/11/10/bayesian-workflow/).
